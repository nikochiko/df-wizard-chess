🤔 What is Wizard Chess?
=======================
To truly understand, I will have you read this

    **What do you do when you really want to play blindfold chess but you're stuck at home? 🏠**

    *Ask your chess friends - easy 👨‍👨‍👧‍👦*

    **They don't like blindfold 🤷**

    *Google for an online solution 💻, there are so many chess apps. There has to be one about blindfold chess.*

    **Pbbt 👅 There ain't one.**

    *What about.. the popular ones?*

    **They say "hide your pieces, it's just like blindfold chess 😇"**

    *Ugh - that's a scam*

    **I have to do something about this.. 👨‍🔧🍳**

Wizard Chess is **that** something. The goal is to provide the best blindfold chess experience.
That is, to have anything you might need while playing blindfold chess - be it a platform to play,
a platform to learn, or a platform to further develop your prowess. See `🧐 How do you do it?`_
for the technical details.

Wizard Chess is already available as a Google Action!
See `🏄🏽‍♂️ Where can I play it?`_ to know more.

🧐 How do you do it?
===================
We use the wizardry 🔮 of AI assistants and chatbots to interact with the user. When a user talks to
our AI asssistant, the message is forwarded to `Dialogflow <http://dialogflow.com/>`_. It
processes the request from the assistant - intelligently, with machine learning - and sends it to our
`webhook <https://sendgrid.com/blog/whats-webhook/>`_. Now our server uses this cooked data to generate
a response and sends it back to Dialogflow which in turn sends it to the assistant. The whole process
basically looks like this:
::
    User ======= |AI assistant/chatbot| <-------> |Dialogflow| <-------> |THIS SERVER| 💪

Examples of operations done on our end are creating and storing chess games in a database,
receiving a move and updating the board accordingly, and generating responses for the user.

🏄🏽‍♂️ Where can I play it?
=======================
The app is already available for the Google Assistant `here <https://assistant.google.com/services/a/uid/0000003ba609b4ff?hl=en>`_.
More platforms coming soon! Let me know via `email <mailto:ktvm42@gmail.com>`_ or `Gitter <https://gitter.im/wizard-chess/community>`_
if you want to see Wizard Chess on a particular platform so that we can prioritize it.
